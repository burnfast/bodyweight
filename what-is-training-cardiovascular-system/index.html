Is when a blood vessel narrows, making it harder for blood to flow through it. Cardiovascular training, also known as aerobic training, is exercise that increases your muscular endurance by improving the performance of your lungs and heart so they can distribute oxygen to the muscles more efficiently. ‘physical conditioning that exercises the heart, lungs and associated blood vessels’. This type of training involves intensities of around 40 to 60% of maximum heart rate.
