<p>Less energy (atp) is produced. This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (o2) in order to create atp.</p>

<p>Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives. In aerobic respiration, the glucose is the complete break down into carbon dioxide and water by oxidation. It is a type of respiration that requires oxygen to occur, and produces water, carbon dioxide and atp. So, depending upon oxygen availability, respiration can be aerobic or anaerobic.

<p>When a cell needs to release energy, the cytoplasm (a substance between a cell's nucleus and its membrane) and mitochondria (organelles in cytoplasm that help with metabolic processes) initiate chemical exchanges that launch the breakdown of glucose. Aerobic respiration produces a considerable amount of energy for use by the organism which gets stored in the atp molecules.
