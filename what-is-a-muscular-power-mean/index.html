<p>Strength, power, muscular endurance, and conditioning are all expressions of muscular ability, as well as overall physical ability, in one way or another.while overlap occurs from one to the next, there are clear differences between each form of muscular output. Muscle power is the amount of work a muscle or muscle group can generate over a period of time. Muscular power refers to a great force production over a short period of time, such as in fast leg kicks and explosive jumping.

<p>Power is speed plus strength. Measures of muscular performance cannot be conveniently categorized as “strength” or “power” on the basis of the contractile velocity employed in the performance task. Motor unit recruitment is a measure of how many motor neurons are activated in a particular muscle. Power is important in sport because it is a reflection of the body’s energy production, applied to generate. L2. Health, Fitness And Performance.</p>
