<p>It is speculated that aerobic exercise can accelerate energy metabolism. Aging is associated with a deterioration of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, primarily as a result of physical deconditioning, increased abdominal obesity (1, 2), and impaired insulin action in the skeletal muscle (3, 4).increased abdominal obesity with aging is a direct result of poor dietary habits and reduced physical activity, as well as genetic and hormonal. O2 can now be diffused into the muscle from the capillaries more.
