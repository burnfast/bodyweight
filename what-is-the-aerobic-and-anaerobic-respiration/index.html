Aerobic respiration involves a gas exchange in which oxygen is taken and carbon dioxide is expelled. The cellular respiration, both aerobic and anaerobic, is a process of transferring the energy from glucose to atp. The difference in the level of organisms. As we know, a cell in any living body helps carry out all the essential functions to stay alive.

<p>Both types of respiration are necessary for the cells in our bodies to create energy, but they occur in different ways. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. Aerobic respiration is a process of a set of metabolic reactions that occurs in the presence of oxygen, transpiring in a cell to transform chemical energy into atps.: The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is that aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen whereas aerobic respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen.
