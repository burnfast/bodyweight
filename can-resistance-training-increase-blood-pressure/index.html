<p>The authors concluded that resistance training by itself is effective in reducing blood pressure among hypertensive individuals. However, resistance training activities such as heavy gardening can also lower risk for hypertension, lower resting blood pressure, improve cholesterol and decrease chronic inflammation. While aerobic and dynamic resistance exercise appear effective at reducing blood pressure, a new study led by unsw medicine &amp; health researchers has revealed isometric resistance training (irt) as an emerging mode of exercise demonstrating effectiveness in reducing office blood pressure.

There is limited evidence for comparison of aerobic training and resistance training in reducing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure. Arterial hypertension (htn) is a highly prevalent chronic medical condition, characterized by high and sustained levels of blood pressure (bp) ().its progression can cause structural and functional changes in target organs and in the metabolic system, leading to clinical complications and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality ().
