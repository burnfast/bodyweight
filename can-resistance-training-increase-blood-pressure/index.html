There is limited evidence for comparison of aerobic training and resistance training in reducing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure. Arterial hypertension (htn) is a highly prevalent chronic medical condition, characterized by high and sustained levels of blood pressure (bp) ().its progression can cause structural and functional changes in target organs and in the metabolic system, leading to clinical complications and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality ().
