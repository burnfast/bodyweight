<p>I have included the bloodwork of the cardiolipin tests. The presence of serum anticardiolipin (acl) antibody without clinical symptoms does not support a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Studies indicate that there is a higher prevalence of igm positives than igg in the general population with these isotypes occurring in 9.4% and 6.5% of the population, respectively. A positive result supports the diagnosis only in the presence of thrombosis or fetal loss. Correlation Of Anticardiolipin Antibody (Aca) Igg And Aca Igm (In P&hellip; |  Download Table.</p>
