<p>Cardiac sphincter prevents the backflow of stomach acids and content into the esophagus, while pyloric sphincter controls the release of chyme from the stomach into the duodenum. The cardiac sphincter that lies at the lower end of the esophagus acts like a valve that ensures unidirectional flow of ingested food. When the pyloric valve doesn't work properly, food stays in the stomach, and symptoms such as bloating, nausea, vomiting, reflux can occur. Unlike the lower esophageal sphincter (les), which opens and closes without our conscious effort, the upper esophageal sphincter is under our conscious control.</p>
