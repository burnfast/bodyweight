Regulate our body temperature and maintain our bodies fluid balance. Body systems work together, to make sure that you have enough energy to perform. When exercise commences, the body responds to the energy requirements of the activity. During exercise at maximal intensity, the cardia output may be 4 times the level it is at rest.

<p>When exercising the muscles require a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients, as well as needing the co2 they produce to be taken away.

<p>There is an increased demand for oxygen and energy substrates during exercise, and acute responses are activated to meet these needs. Oxygen is provided by blood flow, and, in essence, changes in organ perfusion are also closely associated with alterations in tissue metabolism. Over time, resistance training can lead to increased muscle mass, increased bone density, decreased fatigue, and stronger. Increasing the size and number of mitochondria in most cells.
