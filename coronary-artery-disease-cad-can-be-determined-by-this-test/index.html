This may be enough to suspect coronary artery disease (cad). Cad causes one in six deaths in the united states and is the leading cause of death globally.1 annually, approximately 635,000 americans experience a new coronary event, 280,000 have a recurrent ischemic event, and an additional 150,000 have a silent first myocardial infarction. Ct scan (computerized axial tomography) consists of many radiographs shot at the same time from different angles. This process is called atherosclerosis.
