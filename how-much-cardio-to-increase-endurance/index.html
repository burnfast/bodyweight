Your maximum heart rate can be estimated at 220 minus your age. If it does, you’re doing it wrong. There are several ways in which you can increase your cardio endurance so that the next time you are doing something that requires cardio activity, you do not feel as though your legs are going to fall off or that you are going to topple over from exhaustion.
