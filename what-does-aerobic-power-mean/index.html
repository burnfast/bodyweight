It is a function both of cardiorespiratory performance. Maximal aerobic power describes the functional capacity of the cardiorespiratory system and is defined as the maximum rate at which oxygen can be used during a specified period, usually during intense exercise. In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen. This typically involves any exercise that lasts longer than two minutes in duration.

<p>Aerobic exercise is any type of cardiovascular conditioning or “cardio ” during cardiovascular conditioning, your breathing and heart rate increase for a sustained period of time. It is demonstrated by a leveling off or decline in oxygen consumption with increasing intensity. Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes. Maximal aerobic power describes the functional capacity of the cardiorespiratory system and is defined as the maximum rate at which oxygen can be used during a specified period, usually during intense exercise.

<p>Anaerobic exercises involve quick bursts of energy and are performed at maximum effort for a short time. However, in some people, the body produces too much lactic acid and it builds up in the blood, leading to fatigue and pain. It’s a reflection of your aerobic power and your body’s ability to keep performing under strenuous activity for longer periods of time.
