It is a function both of cardiorespiratory performance. Maximal aerobic power describes the functional capacity of the cardiorespiratory system and is defined as the maximum rate at which oxygen can be used during a specified period, usually during intense exercise. In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen. This typically involves any exercise that lasts longer than two minutes in duration.

<p>Aerobic exercise is any type of cardiovascular conditioning or âcardio â during cardiovascular conditioning, your breathing and heart rate increase for a sustained period of time. It is demonstrated by a leveling off or decline in oxygen consumption with increasing intensity. Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes.

<p>Anaerobic exercises involve quick bursts of energy and are performed at maximum effort for a short time. However, in some people, the body produces too much lactic acid and it builds up in the blood, leading to fatigue and pain. Itâs a reflection of your aerobic power and your bodyâs ability to keep performing under strenuous activity for longer periods of time.
