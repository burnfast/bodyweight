What Is Cellular Respiration Mean In Science SHOTWERK From shotwerk.blogspot.com
[adjective] living, active, or occurring only in the presence of oxygen. In this process, a food molecule breaks down. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ).

<p>Aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration. In living cells, a process that uses oxygen to break down complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy. Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food.</p>
