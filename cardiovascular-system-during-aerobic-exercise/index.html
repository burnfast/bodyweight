Your muscles produce more energy when you exercise, and the circulatory system&#39;s activity during exercise enhances the supply of fluids, oxygen and nutrients your muscles need for energy production. Kids should have at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise per day. Exercise can impose an immense stress upon many physiological systems throughout the body. Your muscles produce more energy when you exercise, and the circulatory system&#39;s activity during exercise enhances the supply of fluids, oxygen and nutrients your muscles need for energy production.

<p>During exercise, the metabolic demands of the body increase, and changes in the cardiovascular system are required to maintain adequate perfusion. Cardiac output increases significantly during maximal exercise effort due to the increase in sv. By maintaining the aerobic phase of exercise for at least 20 to 30 minutes, three to four times a week, the cardiorespiratory system can improve in. During exercise, efficient delivery of oxygen to working skeletal and cardiac muscles is vital for maintenance of atp production by aerobic mechanisms.</p>
