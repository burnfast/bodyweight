A term used to describe food energy.scientifically, it is the amount of energy needed to raise one kilogram of water, 1 degree celsius. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to working muscles during sustained physical activity, typically expressed as mlo2 kg − 1 min − 1, is often used as a proxy or an objective measure of physical activity [40]. As you define each term, demonstrate it with a spirometer. Children are often tired after school and other activities, and the pull of friends and technology is a competing factor when it comes to exercise.
