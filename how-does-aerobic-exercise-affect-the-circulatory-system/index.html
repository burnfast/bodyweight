<p>During exercise there is an increase in physical activity and muscle cells respire more than they do when the body is at rest. It is not only the muscles and the nervous system that take time to adapt to systematic and intense exercise. The human circulatory system is a double circulatory system. Physical exercise is one of the most effective methods to help prevent cardiovascular (cv) disease and to promote cv health.</p>
