<p>The walking is extremely easy for me. One method to calculate your approximate maximum heart rate is the formula: Working in your peak heart rate zone in cardiovascular training helps increase your anaerobic threshold (at), the point at which your energy sources move from utilizing a higher percentage of fat to utilizing a higher percentage of carbohydrates.

<p>In this case, then 180 is the maximum heartbeat rate that is permissible for the person. It is essential to know your personal maximum heart rate in order to calculate effective target heart rates to use during exercise.

<p>The target heart rate is a guideline which can help you stay in a safe exercise heart rate range. To train at this intensity, pick a form of exercise that allows you to easily control your heart rate, such as walking or cycling.
