What does aerobic respiration produce? Quora From quora.com
The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. Carbondioxide, water and large amounts of energy in the form of heat. For vigorous exercise our heart and lungs.

End products of anaerobic respiration are ethyl alcohol and less amounts of energy. Aerobic &amp; anaerobic respiration.</p>

<p>Muscles need oxygen and glucose to respire aerobically and produce. It release energy by break down your glucose using oxygen. Aerobic respiration is the process through which glucose is burned or oxidised in the presence of oxygen to produce energy (atp). Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives.

<p>Anaerobic respiration most organisms cannot respire without oxygen but some organisms and tissues can continue to respire if the oxygen runs out. Anaerobic respiration is a procedure of cellular respiration that occurs in the absence of oxygen. However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both.

The differences between aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration include where the processes occur, what chemicals are involved in the processes, and what substances are produced by the two processes. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements.
