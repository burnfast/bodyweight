<p>Our myogenic heart read more » A myogenic heart is sort of a human heart. The myogenic response is defined either as constriction of a vessel in response to an increase in transmural pressure, or stretch, or as dilation in response to a decrease in pressure [21].the myogenic responsiveness of coronary arterioles is truly myogenic, meaning it arises from an inherent response in the smooth muscle myocytes, and myogenic reactions are generally.

<p>Control of the basic heartbeat is myogenic, which means the heart will beat without any external stimulus; The sa node has the inherent power of generating a wave of contraction and controlling the heartbeat. It will beat all on it’s own and doesn’t need any external stimulus. Since the heartbeat is initiated by the sa node and the impulse of contraction originates in the heart itself, the human heart is termed as myogenic. The Study of Human Heart (PDF version).</p>

<p>The sa node has the inherent power of generating a wave of contraction and controlling the heartbeat. The sinoatrial node (san) is a group of cells in the wall of the right atrium. This is because heart muscle cells continuously depolarise without any external stimulus. Myogenic is the term used for muscles or tissues that can contract on their own, without any external electrical stimulus, from the brain or spinal cord for example. Estrogen reduces myogenic tone through a nitric oxidedependent.</p>

<p>The human heart is known for its predominant function of pumping blood to parts of the body. When used to describe the heart does it mean that the heart contracts without having a message from the brain.as the pace maker does it.
