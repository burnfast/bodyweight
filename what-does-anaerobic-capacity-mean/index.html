All about Aerobics From slideshare.net
Anaerobic capacity is most commonly reported in terms of peak power output, whereas aerobic capacity is usually expressed in terms of peak oxygen consumption. Anaerobic creatures or processes do not need oxygen in order to function or survive. Aerobic capacity, also called maximal oxygen uptake, is characterized by the amount of oxygen the body produces and circulates to all major organs to regulate systemic homeostasis. Anaerobic threshold refers to a physiological process of the human body characterized by an increase of lactate (lactic acid) in the blood, which occurs during high levels of intense physical activity.
