Changes in hrv with exercise training have often been interpreted as increases in vagal activity. A number of formulas have been developed to estimate training zones based around maximum heart rate. Studies are clearly needed to assess if this electrolyte formula can reduce maximal heart rate during high intensity training as well as its impact on the resting heart rate. Spb explores the concept of training zones for endurance athletes, explains how successfully targeting your desired training zone can be achieved without.

<p>Changes in hrv with exercise training have often been interpreted as increases in vagal activity. Studies are clearly needed to assess if this electrolyte formula can reduce maximal heart rate during high intensity training as well as its impact on the resting heart rate. The most common way of doing this is to subtract your age from 220, the result is your mhr.

This variation is due to the attenuation of the parasympathetic activity to the heart during inhalation. Endurance training is accompanied by a significant fall in resting heart rate (hr) (3,5,9,16,18,19,26).this is certainly due to a reduction in intrinsic heart rate, linked to stabilization of the cell conduction system membrane, as well as a high degree of vagal control of the sinus node.

<p>There are a multitude of factors that can cause heart rate to increase or decrease without a change in exercise intensity. Exercising at certain intensities are known to elicit adaptive responses from the body, for example, exercising at or below the lactate threshold. Heart rate monitoring has been used extensively to classify training load in endurance training, but scientific interest in this issue for strength training has only begun in earnest since the turn of the century.
