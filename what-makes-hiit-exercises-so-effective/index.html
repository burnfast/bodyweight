Hiit workouts are the ideal way to burn up to 1000 calories in 45 minutes. In each workout we do a five minute warm up to prevent injuries and prepare your body for the following workout. Hiit is so good for weight loss because, after super intense workouts, your body will enter a state in which it works extra hard to make up for the lack of oxygen in your system.
