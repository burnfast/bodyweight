The “lexistress” test (also known as a form of myocardial perfusion imaging [mpi]) gives information about the blood flow to the heart muscle. The myocardial perfusion scan looks at how well your heart is pumping. Modalities such as cta and cmr angiography provide primarily anatomical data, allowing for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Atherosclerosis, known to be the commonest cause for cvd, is precipitated by leading a.
