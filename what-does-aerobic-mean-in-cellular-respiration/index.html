What Is The Word And Balanced Symbol Equation For Anaerobic Respiration From tessshebaylo.com
The equation for aerobic respiration shows glucose being combined with oxygen and adp to produce carbon dioxide, water, and atp: &#39;aero&#39; means air, which contains oxygen, leading to the name aerobic respiration. Cellular respiration is the process through which the biochemical energy converts into the energy in atp. It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp.
