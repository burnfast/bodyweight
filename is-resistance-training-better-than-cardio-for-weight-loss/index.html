<p>Aerobic endurance training wins hands down for metabolic disease management. If you are looking to lose weight and burn fat, don't be afraid of lifting weights! The fact of the matter is that resistance training and cardio come in many different methods and protocols. Resistance training may burn fewer calories in the short term when compared with aerobic exercise alone however for each additional lb of lean muscle you add to your frame the body will burn 120 calories per day more just by sitting on the sofa.</p>
