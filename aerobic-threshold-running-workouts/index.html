<p>We know that aerobic threshold training is used to train the pace right at aerobic threshold, or as used as a recovery intensity between harder intervals. The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. In most reasonably fit people aerobic threshold occurs at around 70% of their maximum heart rate. Your body will become more efficient at removing lactic acid and your endurance will improve.
