The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit.
How Exercise affects breathing rate, pulse rate, heart rate and blood From hubpages.com
When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that aren’t working much (like your digestive tract or arms). The blood volume and blood flow returning to your heart increases. Exercise machines such as treadmills or exercise bicycles have heart rate monitoring devices built on their handlebars. The same person&#39;s heart should beat between 137 and 166 beats per minute upon engaging in a vigorous form of exercise such as swimming laps or jumping rope.
