<p>In contrast, unnecessary demands are placed on the heart by excessive arterial pressure. It is directly linked to the cardiac output. Mean arterial pressure cannot be calculated as the simple average of systolic and diastolic pressures because averaging does not take into account the fact that a greater fraction of each cardiac cycle is spent in.
