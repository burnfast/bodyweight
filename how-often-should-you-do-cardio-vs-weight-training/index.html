&#34;Do I focus on losing fat before getting fit? Cardio or weights From laurengleisberg.com
Research has shown that when you lift weights before you do cardio: If you want to maintain the elasticity of your skin, look trim, look fit, strong, then i highly recommend that you put a lot of your energy into first lifting weights compared to doing cardio. Most people with fat loss goals, in addition to their lifting program, do at least 3 to 4 days a week of formal cardio, usually 30 to 60 minutes at a moderate to moderately hard intensity (enough to get heart rate and breathing up). However, unless you are focusing on burning extra calories to meet a weight loss goal, michaels says you don’t need to do cardio and weight training on the same day.
