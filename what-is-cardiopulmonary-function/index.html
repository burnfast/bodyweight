An understanding of normal cardiopulmonary function and how it changes in aging as a result of sedentary lifestyle or pathologic conditions provides a necessary foundation for rehabilitation professionals working with patients who require an orthosis or prosthesis to walk. The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss recent data regarding the cardiopulmonary effects of pe deformity and the evidence for improvement obtained after surgical repair including (1) a greater efficiency of breathing (chest wall mechanics), (2) improvement in pulmonary restrictive deficits, (3) an increase in cardiac chamber size.
