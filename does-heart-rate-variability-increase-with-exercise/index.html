Heart rate variability, on the other hand, measures the specific changes in time between successive heart beats. Anything you do to improve your heart health will also improve its hrv. Hrv is strongly associated with heart rate, which in turn, is associated with heart size. If you work out, it’s also a sign that your body needs recovery time.
