<p>Peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an occlusive atherosclerotic disease that affects blood vessels, reducing the blood flow of the lower limbs. Objective resistance training (rt) improves walking ability in persons with peripheral artery disease. Both resistance training groups performed 3 sets of 8 repetitions of exercises for 7 different muscle groups. Resistance training is usually prescribed in addition to walking or other forms of aerobic exercise, although it should be noted that the effects of this combined approach have not been systematically examined in pad.</p>
