The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of resistance respiratory muscle training (rrmt. Respiratory muscle training (rmt) has been shown to improve divers swimming endurance at 4 feet of depth; Thus, their training needs to include almost all the training methods, because they require a good level of endurance, whether they swim short or long distances. Therefore, the muscles need to have endurance in order to contract multiple times so the swimmer can get to.
