Your body gets to grips with how to utilise more oxygen, which it converts. Perform some anaerobic training and your other training will get easier. The body uses this oxygen to break down energy sources like fats and glucose to release energy we can use to perform the exercise. Anaerobic exercise is said to strengthen muscles, increase joint mobility and reduce risk of musculoskeletal injury.
