<p>Cardiopulmonary testing increases the demands of both the cardiovascular and respiratory system, but, given that the respiratory capacity is utilized only at peak exercise in healthy patients, exercise is usually limited by cardiac factors before respiratory function limits exercise capacity in normal individuals. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is a maximal exercise test with concomitant gas exchange analysis that provides an integrative and comprehensive assessment of physiologic responses to exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness. A cardiopulmonary exercise test (cpet) is performed to assess current levels of fitness.

<p>A cardiopulmonary exercise test (cpet) is performed to assess current levels of fitness. This is a test that reports a large number of physiologic measurements during exercise when the patient is asked to exercise to his or her. Cardiopulmonary testing increases the demands of both the cardiovascular and respiratory system, but, given that the respiratory capacity is utilized only at peak exercise in healthy patients, exercise is usually limited by cardiac factors before respiratory function limits exercise capacity in normal individuals. It can tell the healthcare team how much exercise you can do. The athlete during cardiopulmonary test. Download Scientific Diagram.</p>
