It measures how much your heart and blood vessels transport blood during working out. It is a broad term, which measures how well you can perform a rhythmic, dynamic activity at a moderate to high. Cardiovascular endurance is the ability of the heart, lungs and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to working muscles and tissues, as well as the ability of those muscles and tissues to utilize that oxygen. To keep everything fed and clean, your heart then has to speed up, which places more stress on your veins, arteries and capillaries.
