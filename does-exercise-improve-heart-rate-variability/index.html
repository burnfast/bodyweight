Heart rate and heart rate variability responses to submaximal exercise From researchgate.net
While we are on the topic of work and hrv, studies show that avoiding shift work is another way to increase your heart rate variability. Stay in a target zone between 114 and 161 bpm. Heart rate variability, a noninvasive marker of parasympathetic activity, diminishes with aging and is augmented after exercise training. The mediterranean diet has been shown to help protect the heart, and is likely to help improve your heart rate variability.
