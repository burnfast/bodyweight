Prolonged, intense cardio sessions do just this by decreasing t3 output and potentially impairing future hormonal responses. The other issue is that chronically doing too much cardio can lead to actually losing muscle. But it is a great start, especially if you are carrying a few pounds of excess you want to get rid of.</p>

<p>By renée onque october 23, 2021 reviewed by k. For those who need a lot of body fat to burn off cardio is essential but if u only have a couple of percents to loose i would say just focus on weight lifting and eating clean.

Your standard bench press doesn’t come with the digital calorie counting box that a treadmill does, but it burns approximately one hell of a lot more calories.
